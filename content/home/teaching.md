**PM 520: Advanced Statistical Computing**  
*University of Southern California, Spring 2024*  
Professor: Nicholas Mancuso
- This course seeks to introduce students to theory and hands-on programming underlying advanced statistical computing. Modern statistical inference requires computational approaches that consider numerical stability (e.g., solving linear systems, “logsumexp” trick), optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent, natural gradient descent), automatic differentiation, and scalability in the face of ever-increasing data (e.g., variational inference).
