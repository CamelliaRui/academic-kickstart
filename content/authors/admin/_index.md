I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at University of Southern California, working on developing machine learning and statistical methods on elucidating genetic architecture of complex diseases with [Prof. Nick Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/) 
and [Prof. Steven Gazal](https://gazal-lab.org/). During my undergraduate at USC, I served as a research assistant at center of genetic epidemiology, working on developing statistical analysis pipeline to assess the genotyping imputation quality of diverse populations worldwide with [Prof. Charleston Chiang](https://chianglab.usc.edu/). 

I'm passioante about applying cutting edge machine learning/statistical methods in industry. Actively looking for 2025 summer intern opportunties! Happy to connect via LinkedIn, and may be reached at crui@usc.edu.
