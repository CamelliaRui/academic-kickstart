A math major undergraduate who wants to work in the health science. Fearing of the Wisconsin's cold as well as fearing of debugging the code. Loving matcha ice creams as well as loving Bayes. Interested in biostatistics and genetic epidemiology. Previously working with monkeys and rats in a wet lab and now working with Python and R in a dry lab.
